# About This Project

## Dictionary Lookup with Intelligent Suggestions

This project is a simple yet effective Python-based dictionary application that allows users to look up words and receive definitions. It includes intelligent suggestions for misspelled words using Python's `difflib` library to provide the closest matches.

## Features
- **Case Insensitive Search:** Handles words in lowercase, title case, and uppercase (e.g., "usa" â†’ "USA").
- **Spelling Correction:** If a word is misspelled, the program suggests the closest match.
- **User-Friendly Interaction:** Prompts the user to confirm suggested words before displaying results.
- **Handles Multiple Definitions:** If a word has multiple meanings, it returns them as a list.

## How It Works
1. Loads dictionary data from a JSON file (`data.json`).
2. Accepts user input for a word to look up.
3. Searches for an exact match in various cases.
4. If no exact match is found, suggests the closest word using `get_close_matches` from the `difflib` module.
5. Asks the user whether they meant the suggested word before returning results.
6. Displays the definition(s) or prompts the user to check their spelling.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dictionary-project.git
   cd dictionary-project
   ```
2. Ensure Python is installed (Python 3 recommended).
3. Prepare the `data.json` file containing dictionary words and definitions in key-value format.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python dictionary.py
   ```
5. Enter a word when prompted and receive its definition(s) or suggestions.

## Example Output
```
Enter word: rain
Rain is water that falls from the sky.
```
```
Enter word: thnder
Did you mean thunder instead? Enter Y if yes, or N if no: Y
Thunder is the sound caused by lightning.
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
- Add pronunciation support using text-to-speech libraries.
- Expand the dictionary dataset for more comprehensive word coverage.
